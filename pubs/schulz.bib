abstract = {The analysis of the memory access behavior of applications, an essential step for a successful cache optimization, is a complex task. It needs to be supported with appropriate tools and monitoring facilities. Currently, however, users can only rely on either simulation based approaches, which deliver a large degree of detail but are restricted in their applicability, or on hardware counters embedded into processors, which allow to keep track of very few, mostly global events and hence only provide limited data.In this work a proposal for novel hardware monitoring facility is presented which exhibits both the details of traditional simulations and the low--overhead of hardware counters. Like the latter approach, it is also targeted towards an implementation within the processor for a direct and non--intrusive access to caches and memory busses. Unlike traditional counters, however, it delivers a detailed picture of the complete memory access behavior of applications. This is achieved by generating so--called memory access histograms, which show access frequencies in relation to the applications address space. Such spatial memory access information can then be used for efficient program optimization by focusing on the code and data segments which were found to exhibit a poor cache behavior.},

abstract = {Debugging intermittently occurring bugs within MPI applications is challenging, and message races, a condition in which two or more sends race to match with a receive, are one of the common root causes. Many debugging tools have been proposed to help programmers resolve them, but their runtime interference perturbs the timing such that subtle races often cannot be reproduced with debugging tools. We present novel noise injection techniques to expose message races even under a tool's control. We first formalize this race problem in the context of non-deterministic parallel applications and use this analysis to determine an effective noise-injection strategy to uncover them. We codified these techniques in NINJA (Noise INJection Agent) that exposes these races without modification to the application. Our evaluations on synthetic cases as well as a real-world bug in Hypre-2.10.1 show that NINJA significantly helps expose races.},
